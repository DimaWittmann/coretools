Welcome to IOTile
=================

IOTile is a device-to-cloud framework for building connected hardware 
devices.  The goal of IOTile is to make it easy to build and deploy custom
Internet-connected devices, all the way from the low-level hardware and firmware
up through secure connectivity and data storage in the cloud.

CoreTools provides an extensible python based infrastructure for creating
and interacting with IOTile Devices.
