    # The list here is complete (excluding Python 2.6, which
    # isn't covered by this document) at the time of writing.

    - PYTHON: "C:\\Python27"
    - PYTHON: "C:\\Python27-x64"

install:
  # We need wheel installed to build wheels
  - "%PYTHON%\\python.exe -m pip install wheel tox"

build: off

test_script:
  - "cd iotilecore; tox; cd .."
  - "cd iotilegateay; tox; cd .."

#after_test:
  # This step builds your wheels.
  # Again, you only need build.cmd if you're building C extensions for
  # 64-bit Python 3.3/3.4. And you need to use %PYTHON% to get the correct
  # interpreter
#  - "build.cmd %PYTHON%\\python.exe setup.py bdist_wheel"

artifacts:
  # bdist_wheel puts your built wheel in the dist directory
  - path: 
    - iotilecore\dist\*
    - iotilebuild\dist\*
    - iotilegateway\dist\*
    - transport_plugins\bled112\dist\*

#on_success:
#  You can use this step to upload your artifacts to a public website.
#  See Appveyor's documentation for more details. Or you can simply
#  access your wheels from the Appveyor "artifacts" tab for your build.
